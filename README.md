# GameSite
Final project for CodeAcademy. There will be a simple game site.
Hello everyone!

So this is my final project for codeacademy, as my final project i decided to create a small, more orientated project from back end side.
This project spins arround php laravel, html, css and javascript. There are three games: snake, wordle(Only lithuanian five letter words)
and sudoku. There are home page filled with variables, it counts times played that user played, and shows your highscores. Ad that's about it
For the future i have plans to create a small e-shop, in which you can buy background skins, or new skin for a snake.

This project was written in PHP 8.1 version, using Laravel 10 framework.

"require": {
        "php": "^8.1",
        "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "^7.2",
        "laravel/framework": "^10.0",
        "laravel/sanctum": "^3.2",
        "laravel/tinker": "^2.8"


To install this project, in your machine, you can clone the whole rapository.
From composer side, there is requirement for autoload, and honestly, i don't there is anything else.

Hope you will try those games for yourself, and if you have any reviews, please inform!
